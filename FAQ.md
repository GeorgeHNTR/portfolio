# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** What's your current rate? \
**A:** ~$15,000 a week for a solo audit and $20-25,000 a week for a team audit with me (*@gogotheauditor*) as the lead auditor and 1 or 2 co-auditors.

**Q:** What's your availability? \
**A:** Normally booked 1-3 weeks in advance. However, we can start on demand for small projects seeking an ASAP start date.

**Q:** What's included in the quote? \
**A:**
 1. Main security review round, identifying as many vulnerabilities and code quality improvements as possible in your codebase.
 2. Comprehensive audit report describing all vulnerabilities found and providing executable tests (Proof-of-Concept) for most critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.
 3. Resolution round - reviewing the implemented fixes for each mitigated vulnerability and updating the report with the resolution status of each finding.
 4. Technical documentation, threat model, and test cases written during the audit.

**Q:** How should we prepare for the audit? \
**A:** There are plenty of blog posts out there that provide pre-audit checklists for smart contract protocols. I would recommend reading through the following thread and making sure to come well-prepared to extract the most value out of the audit:
